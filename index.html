  <h2><b><i>how to make Salmon Cookies </i></b></h2>
  <br>
  <h2><b>Step 1</b></h2> <br>
  <p>Heat oven to 350Â°F. In large bowl, with electric mixer on high, beat together butter and sugar until light and
    fluffy,
    about 2 minutes. Add egg, corn syrup, and vanilla, and beat 1 minute. Reduce mixer speed to low, and beat in flour
    and
    salt until combined. Divide dough in half. Shape each half into a disk.</p> <br>

    invert
    dough onto baking sheet, and remove paper.</p> <br>

  <p>In bowl, with electric mixer on low, beat together all ingredients until combined, reserving 3 tablespoons water.
    Increase speed to high, and continue beating until stiff peaks form. Add reserved 3 tablespoons water to icing to
    thin
    it to the consistency of heavy cream. Divide icing among four bowls, and tint each bowl with food coloring. Using
    fingertip, spread icing over cookies. Place colored candy on some fish for eyes. Let cookies dry completely. To
    make
    colored circles, dip bottle cap into icing bowls and randomly dot tops of dried cookies.</p>
